## What is the Sample App?
This app was created to demonstrate how to use the Domo Apps [Starter Kit](https://github.com/DomoApps/starter-kit) and how commonly requested functionality is implemented in a Domo App.

The app demonstrates simple data formatting, filtering, and display. An "inventory" of products is displayed as well as summaries of transactions. The "Transactions" page demonstrates the use of widgets. Domo Widgets are reusable components that render [d3 charts](https://d3js.org).

Because this app is not attached to an instance of Domo, DataSource requests are mocked in the products and transaction analytics factories. Comments are included to explain how production DataSource requests are made. See the [Domo Developer Guide](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-data) for more information on DataSource requests.

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo
    `$ git clone {URL}`
2. Install dependencies `$ npm install`
3. Run local server `$ npm start`

## Uploading to Domo
1. Login to Domo `$ domo login`
2. Publish sample app `$ npm run upload`
3. Update the `{ id: ... }` value in `domo/manifest.json` with your new app ID

For more information on available commands and usage, see the documentation for the Domo Apps [Starter Kit](https://github.com/DomoApps/starter-kit).
