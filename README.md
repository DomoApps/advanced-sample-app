## What is the Sample App?
This app was created to demonstrate how to use the Domo Apps [Starter Kit](https://github.com/DomoApps/starter-kit) and how commonly requested functionality is implemented in a Domo App

Because this app is not attached to an instance of Domo, DataSource requests are mocked in the products and transaction analytics factories. Comments are included to explain how production DataSource requests are made. See the [Domo Developer Guide](https://developer.domo.com/docs/dev-studio/dev-studio-data) for more information on DataSource requests.
