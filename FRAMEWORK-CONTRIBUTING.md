## Development

Visit the [issue tracker](https://github.com/DomoApps/starter-kit/issues) to find a list of open issues that need attention.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/starter-kit.git
```

Develop your feature or bugfix and create a Pull Request. Our team will review the PR. If we see potential problems with the code's functionality or design, we will ask you to make changes during the review process; otherwise, we will merge your changes and create a new version of starter-kit. Please keep your Pull Request focused to a specific issue.

Make sure your contributions pass starter-kit's unit tests and linter. To run both the tests and the linter, use this command:

```
npm run test
```

Thank you for contributing!
